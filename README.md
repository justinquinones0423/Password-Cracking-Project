# Password-Cracking-Project

Performed a cybersecurity project focused on identifying weak credentials within a text file that contained 1000 hashes. The main challenge was being able to crack at least 250 of the 1000 hashes, which I was able to do by researching known user habits for creating passwords and optimizing attack strategies in combining wordlist, rule-based, and targeted mask attacks. Doing this, I was able to demonstrate skills in applying different cracking techniques with John the Ripper and learning the high importance of password security.
